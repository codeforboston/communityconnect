# Contribute *Writing* Code ‚å®Ô∏è
If you want to write code for the project, start by looking at issues to tackle on our backlog. Can't find anything worth working on? Consider [reporting a bug](#Report-a-Bug-%F0%9F%90%9E) or [suggesting a feature.](#Suggest-a-Feature-%F0%9F%9B%A0)
Our open issues are listed on the project's [Issues](https://github.com/codeforboston/communityconnect/issues) tab. The best places to start are unassigned issues with the label "[good first issue](https://github.com/codeforboston/communityconnect/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee)".

To contribute your code to the project:
1) Fork the project (https://github.com/codeforboston/communityconnect/fork)
2) Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/{{your new feature}}`)
3) Commit your changes to the branch (`git commit -am 'Add {{your changes}}`)
4) Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/{{your new feature}}`)
5) Create a new Pull Request

### A Note on Pull Requests
A good pull request should include:
- [ ] A description of the change being made
- [ ] A reference to the issue being addressed
- [ ] A brief description of how you verified your changes 

If you know someone specific will be interested in your change (such as the issue reporter), add them as a reviewer! Otherwise, all pull requests will be reviewed by contributors and maintainers.

# Contribute *Reading* Code üñ•
You can help contribute to our code base by reviewing [open pull requests on the 'Pull requests' tab](https://github.com/codeforboston/communityconnect/pulls) or by reading our current source code in the `development` branch. 

Check out this [Guide from GitHub on reviewing pull requests](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests) for further tips and suggestions.

# Report a Bug üêû
Want to report an issue or bug you've found in Community Connect? Great! Before creating an issue and submitting a bug report, be sure to [search for related issues](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Acodeforboston%2Fcommunityconnect+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) to see if the problem has already been documented. If the issue has already been reported **and it is still open,** add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

Bugs are tracked as issues in our backlog. To report one, [create an issue](https://github.com/codeforboston/communityconnect/issues/new?labels=bug&title=New+bug+report) including:
- [ ] The `[bug]` label
- [ ] A clear and descriptive title of the problem
- [ ] A description of the issue and expected outcome 
- [ ] Specific steps used to reproduce the problem
    <sub>(examples are welcome, especially images or code snippets!)</sub>
- [ ] A capture of error messages or other unexpected output

# Suggest a Feature üõ†
Community Connect is always growing based on user feedback and suggestions - thanks for sharing yours! Just like [reporting a bug](#Report-a-Bug-%F0%9F%90%9E), be sure to check existing issues for the feature you're requesting - you might not be the only one! 

Feature suggestions (enhancements) are also tracked as issues in our backlog. To suggest a feature or enhnacement, [create an issue](https://github.com/codeforboston/communityconnect/issues/new?labels=enhancement&title=New+feature) including:
- [ ] The `[enhancement]` label
- [ ] A clear and descriptive title of the new behavior or functionality
- [ ] A description of the feature
- [ ] An example depicting this feature 'in the wild' or a simple use case for this feature
- [ ] Why this feature could be useful for you and other users
