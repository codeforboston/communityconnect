Welcome!

Community Connect is based out of Boston and is a team within [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org).

If you want to be involved with the team:

1) Join our [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cfb-public/code-for-boston) and find the #Community-Connect channel. We use it to discuss project direction, requirements etc.
2) Introduce yourself either at the weekly IRL meetup or within the #Community-Connect Slack channel.
3) Go thru our README, our [open tasks](https://github.com/codeforboston/communityconnect/issues), and the [Code of Conduct](https://www.codeforboston.org/code-of-conduct/).

In terms of contributing 
* First of all, thanks!
* If you aren't sure how to get started or what to work on feel free to ask the team.
* If you do have a sense of an issue you want to work on, please note a few things:
   * Join our Slack & intro yourself before working on anything.
   * If an issue is already assigned to someone, then they are working on it. If it seems like it may be stale, just ask.
   * The [Good First Issue] tasks are intended for those who are new to the team (this means you, if you are reading this for the first time!) 
   * Make sure to get yourself assigned to the issue you are working on to avoid duplicate work
