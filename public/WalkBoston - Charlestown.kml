    <name>WalkBoston - Charlestown</name>
    <description>Charlestown is Boston’s oldest neighborhood—and over the years has arguably been its most volatile.  For centuries the town trained and outfitted the nation’s military forces; it has seen ethnic, racial, and labor tensions simmer and erupt into violence; it has hosted one of history’s most infamous executions.  And that’s not even to mention Charlestown’s two high points (literally!): Bunker Hill (where the first battle of the American Revolution was supposed to take place) and Breeds Hill (where it did).  This walk will take you through the town’s compact heart and past its most colorful and historic sites. </description>

        <name>Bunker Hill Monument</name>
        <description><![CDATA[This obelisk marks the battle on Breed's Hill (the original plan was to defend from Bunker Hill, the next hill over), when colonial troops, fueled by a little bravado (and perhaps a bit of rum), moved toward British troops massed on the harbor.  The monument was dedicated in 1843 with a stirring oration by Daniel Webster and a less memorable speech by John Tyler.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[This square reflects Charlestown's social history.  The grand 1848 double bow-fronted house at 7 Monument Square was built for a Charlestown mayor; "The Bostonians" was in part filmed here.  Two mansions converted to rooming houses were the subject of the 1952 book Rooms to Let by Helen Rush, about World War II and the Navy Yard.  The old Charlestown High School at 30 Monument Square drew strife during busing for school desegregation, as documented in Common Ground by J. Anthony Lukas.]]></description>

The Knights persuaded John Fitzgerald Kennedy, campaigning for his first congressional election, to undergo initiation by marching a goat through Charlestown streets.]]></description>

        <description>As the population of Charlestown increased to a peak of forty-two thousand by 1900--three times what it is today--every square inch of available land was covered with housing.  To improve access, Forty Flights (seven flights of stairs) were built.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[The effort of climbing Forty Flights is rewarded by an expansive view from the real Bunker Hill.  The peaceful burial ground for Irish immigrants (closed to the public) in back of the 1859 St. Francis de Sales Church was established in 1830, over opposition and lawsuits by Charlestown's city government.  Down below, Doherty Playground has sweeping views of the Mystic River.]]></description>

Charlestown's waterfront sparked intensive union organizing in 1872 and remains an area of strong pro-labor sentiment.]]></description>
