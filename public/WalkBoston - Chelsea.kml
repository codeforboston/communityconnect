    <name>WalkBoston - Chelsea</name>
    <description><![CDATA[An unexpected delight, Chelsea offers a glorious setting, restored downtown, civic center, and hilly views of the harbor and downtown skyline.  Looming over the city is the Tobin Bridge--a dramatic landmark that is stunning seen from below.  The bridge and harbor setting highlight Chelsea's traditional role as a gateway into Boston.<br><br>Chelsea fronts on Boston Harbor, at the merging of two rivers--the Mystic and Chelsea Creek.  This location has made it a natural way for products and people traveling into Boston.  As the metro area has grown, Chelsea has been a welcome haven for immigrants, providing inexpensive housing, ample job opportunities, and supportive social services.<br><br>This walk covers Chelsea end to end, ranging from Admiral Hill to Powderhorn Hill, both capped by old military hospitals.  Along the way you will see a dynamic city, always open to diversity.  Look for the influence of ethnic traditions on the street life, restaurants, and shops in this small gateway to Boston.]]></description>

Within twenty-nine months Chelsea had a new City Hall, new library, new hospitals, two new firehouses, and 860 new buildings.

In 1772 the Carys refurbished the house; the English white pine paneling that they added in 1791 is still in place.  At an angle to the street, the mansion faces directly south, unlike other nearby homes.  Legends of the mansion tell of a possible secret tunnel inside, and a duel on the farm's land.]]></description>

        <description>Facing the Mystic River, the former Naval Hospital served from1836 until 1974, when it was decommissioned.  The hospital played a critical role in the 1918 flu epidemic that ravaged the country, leaving more than half a million dead.  The best-known patient was Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, treated for wounds received when his PT boat was cut in half in the Pacific war.  Nearby was the Marine Hospital, dating from 1827 and burned in 1908.  It was replaced by the Shurtleff School, now converted to an early-learning center.  All hospital buildings on the hill have now been converted into condominiums.</description>
